        <h1>Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary</h1>
        <img src="wayanad_wildlife.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
        <p class="text">Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary is a wildlife 
            sanctuary in Wayanad, Kerala, India with an extent of 
            344.44 km2 (132.99 sq mi) and four hill ranges namely 
            Sulthan Bathery, Muthanga, Kurichiat and Tholpetty. 
            A variety of large wild animals such as gaur, Asian 
            elephant, deer and tiger are found there. 
            There are also quite a few unusual birds in the 
            sanctuary. In particular, Indian peafowl tend to 
            be very common in the area. Wayanad Wildlife 
            Sanctuary is the second largest wildlife sanctuary 
            in Kerala. It is bestowed with lush green forests 
            and rich wildlife. This wildlife area houses some 
            of the rare and endangered species of both flora and fauna.

            Established in 1973, the sanctuary is now an integral 
            part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. It is bounded by 
            protected area network of Nagarhole National Park and 
            Bandipur National Park in Karnataka in the northeast, 
            and on the southeast by Mudumalai National Park in 
            Tamil Nadu.<br>

            It is part of the Deccan Plateau and the vegetation 
            is predominantly of the south Indian moist deciduous 
            teak forests. Also, the sanctuary has pastures of the 
            west-coast semi-evergreen trees. The wildlife sanctuary 
            comes under Protect Elephant and one can spot herd of 
            elephants roaming in the area. Elephant rides are arranged 
            by the Kerala Forest Department.<br>

            Wayanad district has the largest population of Adivasi 
            in Kerala. Scheduled tribes here include Paniyas, 
            Kurubas, Adiyans, Kurichiyas, Ooralis and Kattunaikkans. 
            Comprising an area of 2126 km2, Wayanad has a powerful 
            history. Relicts and edicts found in various parts of 
            Wayanad speak of an important prehistoric era. 
            Historians are of the view that organised human 
            life existed in these parts, at least ten centuries 
            before Christ.<br>

            The sanctuary is part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve.
            The Western Ghats, Nilgiri Sub-Cluster (6,000+ km2), 
            including all of the sanctuary, is under consideration 
            by the World Heritage Committee for selection as a World 
            Heritage Site.<br>

            A monitoring programme of the Forest Department for 
            2017-18 has found that the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary 
            (WWS), holds the largest tiger population in the State. 
            Of the total 176 tigers in the State, 75 were identified 
            from the WWS, which is part of a large forest complex 
            holding the single largest population of tigers in India.
